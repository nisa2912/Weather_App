# Weather_App
A weather application that lets the user search for any city around the globe and displays the forecasted weather of the day. This application is created using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. No external libraries or frameworks were used.

This weather app uses the openweathermap API to fetch information on the forecasted weather of the day for any location around the globe. The user can search for any city and the weather information of the day is displayed.
